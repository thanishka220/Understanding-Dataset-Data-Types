## 🧪 Task Performed
The following steps were carried out on the Titanic dataset:

1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas
2. Displayed first and last few records to understand structure
3. Identified numerical, categorical, ordinal, and binary features manually
4. Used `df.info()` and `df.describe()` to analyze data types and statistics
5. Checked unique values in categorical columns
6. Identified target variable and input features
7. Analyzed dataset size for machine learning suitability
8. Observed data quality issues such as missing values and imbalance

## 🎯 Target Variable
- **Survived** (Binary Classification)

---

## 📊 Key Observations
- Dataset contains **891 rows and 12 columns**
- Numerical features include Age, Fare, SibSp, and Parch
- Categorical features include Name, Ticket, Cabin, and Embarked
- Pclass is an ordinal feature
- Binary features include Survived and Sex
- Missing values are present in Age, Cabin, and Embarked
- Cabin column has a large number of missing values
- Target variable Survived is imbalanced
- Dataset is suitable for machine learning after preprocessing

---

## ✅ Final Outcome
- Clear understanding of dataset structure and feature types
- Identification of data quality issues
- Assessment of machine learning readiness
- Prepared foundation for data preprocessing and modeling
